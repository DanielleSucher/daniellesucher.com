My personal site and blog. Powered by Jekyll, theme adapted from [Scribble](https://github.com/muan/scribble).

The `danielle_with_content` branch of this repository contains the content for **my** personal website and blog, which **should not** be used as your blog. If you would like to adapt my adaptation of this Jekyll theme, you will need to delete the `danielle_with_content` branch and create a branch off the `master` branch for your own content.
